- ⚡ Fun fact: Despite being one of the wealthiest cities in the world, approximately 1.5 million New Yorkers live in poverty,
      which is about 18.2% of the population. However, NYC is home to a unique program called “The Community Fridges” initiative.
      This grassroots effort involves volunteers stocking refrigerators placed in various neighborhoods with free food,
      allowing anyone in need to take what they require.
